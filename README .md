Classification of Emotional Antecedents by Analysing Salient Features. 

The goal of this research is to create a machine learning model for categorising human emotions. Emotions are a complicated and individualised experience that is challenging to quantify and classify. But thanks to developments in machine learning, it is now possible to train models to recognise patterns in human speech, facial expressions, and other physiological signals in order to ascertain a person's emotional state.  
As a result of this project, For accurate classification of emotions into predetermined categories like anger, sad, happy, guilty, disgust and surprise, a large dataset will be used to train the model. Both the simple classification algorithms and neural network classification algorithms are used as the models in this work. 
 The successful use of this concept could have profound effects on disciplines including psychology, medicine, and human-computer interaction. 

## Demo

Human emotions has six primary classification and each of them has four different categories and for those categories has multiple sub-categories.

Prediction and classification of human emotions is a very complicated procedure and building a model for the prediction is hard work.
